- The basic syntax of Wireshark filters is some kind of service or protocol like ip or tcp, followed by a dot then whatever is being filtered for example an address, MAC, SRC, protocol, etc.

>In a case where the attacker uses commands we use the `follow > TCP Stream` option to get a detailed view of the commands used by the attacker
