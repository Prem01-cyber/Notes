#### `Getting Started with SQLMap -->`

`sqlmap -h` --> General Listing only basic options (help).
`sqlmap -hh` --> Advanced Listing shows all options and switches (help).

- For more details, users are advised to consult the project's [wiki](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki/Usage), as it represents the official manual for SQLMap's usage.

#### `Basic Scenario -->`

- a penetration tester accesses the web page that accepts user input via a `GET`parameter (e.g., `id`). They then want to test if the web page is affected by the SQL injection vulnerability.
- If so, they would want to exploit it, retrieve as much information as possible from the back-end database, or even try to access the underlying file system and execute OS commands. 
- An example SQLi vulnerable PHP code for this scenario would look as follows:

```php
$link = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database, 3306);
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " . $_GET["id"] . " LIMIT 0, 1";
$result = mysqli_query($link, $query);
if (!$result)
    die("<b>SQL error:</b> ". mysqli_error($link) . "<br>\n");
```

- As error reporting is enabled for the vulnerable SQL query, there will be a database error returned as part of the web-server response in case of any SQL query execution problems. 
- Such cases ease the process of SQLi detection, especially in case of manual parameter value tampering, as the resulting errors are easily recognised

- To run SQLMap against this example, located at the example URL `http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1`, would look like the following

```shell-session
prem@htb[/htb]$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --batch
