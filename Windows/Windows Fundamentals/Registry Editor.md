- We're continuing with Tools that are available through the System Configuration panel.

- `regedit` is a central hierarchical database used to store information necessary to configure the system for one or more users, applications, and hardware devices.
- The registry contains information that Windows continually references during operation, such as:
	- Profiles for each user
	- Applications installed on the computer and the types of documents that each can create
	- Property sheet settings for folders and application icons
	- What hardware exists on the system
	- The ports that are being used.

- to run it we need to specify it as `regedt32.exe`
- `regedt` is for advanced users and should be careful while making changes to this, as it may lead to devastating effects.
