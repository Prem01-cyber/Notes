- User accounts can be one of two types on a typical local Windows system: **Administrator** & **Standard User**.
- It differs completely in the way linux operates, as linux gives ultimate control over the hardware and software to the admin. Whereas windows doesn't promote it so easily.

- The user account type will determine what actions the user can perform on that specific Windows system. 
	- An Administrator can make changes to the system: add users, delete users, modify groups, modify settings on the system, etc. 
	- A Standard User can only make changes to folders/files attributed to the user & can't perform system-level changes, such as install programs

- When a user account is created, a profile is created for the user. The location for each user profile folder will fall under is `C:\Users`.
- For example, the user profile folder for the user account Max will be `C:\Users\Max
- The creation of the user's profile is done upon initial login. When a new user account logs in to a local system for the first time, they'll see several messages on the login screen. 
- One of the messages, User Profile Service, sits on the login screen for a while, which is at work creating the user profile. See below.
