- Windows Update is a service provided by Microsoft to provide security updates, feature enhancements, and patches for the Windows operating system and other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Defender.
- 2nd Tuesday -> `Patch Tuesday` is the day when updates are released

- Throughout the years, Windows users have grown accustomed to pushing Windows Updates off to a later date or not installing the updates at all. 
- Various reasons caused this action, one being the fact that a reboot is typically required after a Windows update.
- This has been addressed since the windows 10 update, as the updates can't be ignored then can only be postponed.
