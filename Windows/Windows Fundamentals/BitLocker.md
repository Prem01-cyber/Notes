- BitLocker Drive Encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers
- On devices with TPM installed, BitLocker offers the best protection.

- BitLocker provides the most protection when used with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or later. 
- The TPM is a hardware component installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturers. 
- It works with BitLocker to help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline
