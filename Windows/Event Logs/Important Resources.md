In this room, we covered Windows Event Logs, what they are, and how to query them using various tools and techniques. 

We also briefly discussed various features within Windows that you need to enable/configure to log additional events to gain visibility into those processes/features that are turned off by default. 

The information covered in this room will serve as a primer for other rooms covering [Windows Internals](https://tryhackme.com/jr/windowsinternals), [Sysmon](https://tryhackme.com/jr/sysmon), and various [SIEM](https://tryhackme.com/jr/splunk101) tools.
