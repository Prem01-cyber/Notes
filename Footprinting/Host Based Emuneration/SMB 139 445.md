#### `Brief -->`

- SMB - Server Message Block Protocol - is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network. [Source](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/Server-Message-Block-Protocol).
- Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 95 have included client and server SMB protocol support. 
- Samba, an open source server that supports the SMB protocol, was released for Unix systems.
#### `Used For -->`

- Servers make file systems and other resources (printers, named pipes, APIs) available to clients on the network. Client computers may have their own hard disks, but they also want access to the shared file systems and printers on the servers.

#### `How does it work -->`

- The SMB protocol is known as a ***response-request protocol***, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection. 
- Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX.

- Once the connection is established client can then send commands (SMBs) to the server that allow them to access shares, open files and read and write files, and generally do all the sort of things that you want to do with file system. 
- In case of smb these things are done over a network

#### `Enumeraing -->`

- The first step of enumeration is to conduct a ***port scan***, to find out as much information as you can about the services, applications, structure and operating system of the target machine. This can be done using [[nmap]]
- scripts used for enumerating shares are 
	`nmap -Pn -p445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse 10.10.11.56`
- ***Enum4linux*** is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares on both Windows and Linux systems
- It is basically a wrapper around the tools in the Samba package and makes it easy to quickly extract information from the target pertaining to SMB. 
- It's installed by default on Parrot and Kali, however if you need to install it, you can do so from the official [github](https://github.com/portcullislabs/enum4linux).
- The syntax of Enum4Linux is nice and simple: `enum4linux [options] ip`

**TAG**            **FUNCTION**  

-U             get userlist  
-M             get machine list  
-N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)  
-S             get sharelist  
-P             get password policy information  
-G             get group and member list

-a             all of the above (full basic enumeration)+

#### `Enumeration Process -->`

- While there are vulnerabilities such as [CVE-2017-7494](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-7494/) that can allow remote code execution by exploiting SMB
- We can use `smbclient` to connect to the target shares.
- `smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE]`, Followed by the tags: -U [name] : to specify the user, -p [port] : to specify the port
- `more` is the alternate for `cat`, when we want to read the content of the file
- Always remember to use double quotes with the files inorder to perform any kind of action with it. Example, `more "Working from home.txt"`
- 

#### `Vulnerabilities -->`

- Typically, there are SMB share drives on a server that can be connected to and used to view or transfer files. 
- SMB can often be a great starting point for an attacker looking to discover sensitive information — you'd be surprised what is sometimes included on these shares.
