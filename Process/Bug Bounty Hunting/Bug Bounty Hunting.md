- we usually consider a bug bounty program as a crowd sourcing initiative through which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for discovering and reporting software bugs.
- It is also called as Vulnerability Resource Program (VRP)
- [Hacker One](https://hackerone.com/bug-bounty-programs) hosts bug bounty programs, and they aptly describe them as Continuous testing, constant protection.

#### `Bug Bounty Program Types -->`

- A bug bounty program can be `private` or `public`.

- `Private bug bounty programs` are not publicly available. Bug bounty hunters can only participate in a private bug bounty program upon receiving specific invitations. The vast majority of bug bounty programs start as private ones and become public after getting the hang of receiving and triaging vulnerability reports.
    
    - Most of the time, bug bounty hunters receive invitations to private bug bounty programs based on their **track record**, valid finding consistency, and **violation record**. A representative example of this is how `HackerOne` deals with [invitations](https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/invitations.html) based on specific criteria. Please note that certain bug bounty programs may even require a **background check**.
- `Public bug bounty programs` are accessible by the entire hacking community.

>[!Note]
>Something important to note is that the terms `Bug Bounty Program (BBP)` and `Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)` should not be used interchangeably.
>
>A vulnerability disclosure program only provides guidance on how an organization prefers receiving information on identified vulnerabilities by third parties. A bug bounty program incentivizes third parties to discover and report software bugs, and bug bounty hunters receive monetary rewards in return.


#### `Bug Bounty Programs code of conduct -->`

- Similar to the continental rules in john wick
- It is a document that establishes expectations for behaviour from members of a community.
- Here is a example of [code of conduct](https://www.hacker101.com/resources/articles/code_of_conduct) of Hacker-one.

#### `Bug Bounty Program Structure -->`

- **Policy section** enables organizations to publish information about their program to communicate the specifics about their program to hackers, They typically publish vulnerability disclosure.
- Policy also include the **scope**. 
- The rest just contains the stuff we need to know like contact info, access, responsibilities and ROE.
