#### `Why are they used -->`

- Once we get access to low privileged account we can use Kernel Exploits to leverage vulnerabilities in the kernel to execute code with root level privileges.

>[!Danger]
>Kernel Exploits can cause system instability, so caution when running these against a production system.

- One of the most famous kernel exploits are  [Dirty COW](https://github.com/dirtycow/dirtycow.github.io) (CVE-2016-5195).

#### `Process of findings -->`

- We start by getting the version of the kernel

>`uname -a` -> gives the kernel level and OS version
>`cat /etc/lsb-release` --> gives the distribution related information.

- Upon searching in google for the exploit based on the version of the kernel and OS we will eventually find the exploit. For example [linux 4.4.0-116-generic exploit](https://vulners.com/zdt/1337DAY-ID-30003) 
- We download the exploit, convert it into a executable and deliver it to the target so that we can gain root level privileges.
