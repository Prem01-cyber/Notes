- it is a well know and versatile hash cracking tool
- It combines a fast cracking speed, with an extraordinary range of compatible hash types
- Hashes are piece of data of any length representing it in another form of fixed length
- Hashing algorithms are designed so that they only operate one way. This means that a calculated hash cannot be reversed using just the output given
- Even though the algorithm itself is not feasibly reversible. That doesn't mean that cracking the hashes is impossible
- You can make the hashing algorithm hash a large number of hashes and compare them to find the pattern.

#### `Installation -->`

- `sudo apt install john`
- We can build it from scratch `git clone https://github.com/openwall/john -b bleeding-jumbo john` and follow the steps
- jumbo john is the most extended version of John the ripper
