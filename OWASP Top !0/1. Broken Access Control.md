- Websites have pages that are protected from regular visitors
- For instance, only site's admin should be able to access the page to manage other users. If a website visitor can access protected pages they are not meant to see, then the **access controls are broken**
- which would lead to 
	- Sensitive information leakage
	- Accessing unauthorised functionality

- broken access control allows attackers to bypass **authorisation**
- For example, a [vulnerability was found in 2019](https://bugs.xdavidhu.me/google/2021/01/11/stealing-your-private-videos-one-frame-at-a-time/), where an attacker could get any single frame from a YouTube video marked as private

#### `IDOR - Insecure Direct Object Reference -->`

- [[IDOR and Logic Errors]] 
- refers to an access control vulnerability where you can access resources you wouldn't ordinarily be able to see
- This occurs when the programmer exposes a Direct Object Reference, which is just an identifier that refers to specific objects within the server
- By object, we could mean a file, a user, a bank account in a banking application, or anything really.

- There is, however, a potentially huge problem here, anyone may be able to change the `id` parameter to something else like `222222`, and if the site is incorrectly configured, then he would have access to someone else's bank information.

- The application exposes a direct object reference through the `id` parameter in the URL
