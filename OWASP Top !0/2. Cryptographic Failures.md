- A **cryptographic failure** refers to any vulnerability arising from the misuse (or lack of use) of cryptographic algorithms for protecting sensitive information. 
- Web applications require cryptography to provide confidentiality for their users at many levels.

- Take, for example, a secure email application:
	- Encrypting data on transit inorder to protect us from eavesdroppers
	- Encrypting data at rest, as our emails are stored in a server

- These issues are mainly caused in web applications i.e, data linked to customers and technical information
- taking advantage of some cryptographic failures often involves techniques such as MITM

#### `Failures -->`

- The most common way to store a large amount of data in a format easily accessible from many locations is in a database, most of them use SQL syntax to store data
- Most of the servers use Maria or MySQL as their production databases
- however these can stored as files. which are referred to as "flat-file" databases, as they are stored as a single file on computer.
- Having saved files as this may not be a problem for a web app but when the app is stored in root directory.

- The most common (and simplest) format of a flat-file database is an SQLite database
- `sqlite3` is client application used to connect with the database
- `sqlite3 <databse name>` to connect with database, `.tables` to list the tables, `PRAGMA table_info(customers);` to get the info of the table customers. We can them dump data with `select`  statements.

- we might face with hashes while querying databases like password hashes and stuff
- There are many tools to crack the hashes. for instance, `johntheripper`,   [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net/), `cyberchef`
- Crackstation is good at breaking weak password hashes. Most MD5 can be decoded with the help of this tool.
