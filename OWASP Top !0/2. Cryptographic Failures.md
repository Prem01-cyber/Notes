- A **cryptographic failure** refers to any vulnerability arising from the misuse (or lack of use) of cryptographic algorithms for protecting sensitive information. 
- Web applications require cryptography to provide confidentiality for their users at many levels.

- Take, for example, a secure email application:
	- Encrypting data on transit inorder to protect us from eavesdroppers
	- Encrypting data at rest, as our emails are stored in a server

- These issues are mainly caused in web applications i.e, data linked to customers and technical information
- taking advantage of some cryptographic failures often involves techniques such as MITM
