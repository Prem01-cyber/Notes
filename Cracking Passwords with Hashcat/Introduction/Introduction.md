- Password cracking, or offline brute force attacks, is an effective way of gaining access to unauthorized resources.
- Various applications and systems make use of cryptographic algorithms to hash or encryption. Doing so it protects data in a MITM attack.
- Password cracking attacks attempt to recover the original data by performing brute force attacks against various algorithms and divulge the cleartext password.
- Weak and reused passwords are two major factors that can determine the success of this attack.
- A variety of open-source tools exist to facilitate password cracking, but `Hashcat` is one of the best tools available.
