#### `Security Assessment -->`

- Security Assessments are done by organisations to find and confirm **vulnerabilities** are present, by which we can **patch, mitigate or remove** them.
- Each organisation has their own way of securing their computer systems, no matter who every organisation has to stay on top of both legacy and recent vulnerabilities and have a system to check for **detecting and mitigating risks** to their systems and data.

#### `Vulnerability Assessement -->`

- Vulnerability assessments are performed because an organization chooses to conduct them, and they can control how and when they're assessed
- A vulnerability assessment is **the testing process used to identify and assign severity levels to as many security defects as possible in a given timeframe**. This process may involve automated and manual techniques with varying degrees of rigour and an emphasis on comprehensive coverage.
- Vulnerability assessments may be performed independently or alongside other security assessments depending on an organisation's situation

#### `Penetration Test -->`

- Testers perform tests to determine they can penetrate the network. it is a type of simulated cyber attack, and pen-testers conduct actions that a threat actor may perform to see if certain kinds of exploits are possible.
- Difference between Pen-testing and an actual cyber attack is that the former is done with a **Legal Form of Consent** of the entity being pen-tested.
- As with a vulnerability assessment, an effective pentest will result in a detailed report full of information that can be used to improve a network's security. All kinds of pentest's can be performed according to an organization's specific needs.

1. **Black Box Pentesting** --> No Knowledge of the network
2. **Grey Box Pentesting** --> a bit of knowledge of the network
3. **White Box Pentesting** --> full access to everything required

- Often, pentesters specialize in a particular area. Penetration testers must have knowledge of many different technologies but still will usually have a speciality

- **Application Pentester** --> assess web applications and thick client applications, API and mobile applications
- **Network Pentester** --> assess the network devices. They use tools like nessus, for a proper pentesting process. The difference must be known between evasive, non-evasive, hybrid evasive[^1]. 
- **Physical Pentester** --> leverage physical security weaknesses and breakdowns in processes to gain access to a facility such as a data center or office building.
- **Social Engineering Pentester** --> pentesters test human beings.

#### `Vulnerability Assessments vs Penetration Tests -->`

- Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration tests are entirely different assessments. Vulnerability assessments look for vulnerabilities in networks without simulating cyber attacks.
- A wide variety of security standards could be used for a vulnerability assessment, such as **GDPR compliance** or **OWASP web application** security standards. A vulnerability assessment goes through a checklist.
	- Do we meet this standard?
	- Do we have this configuration?

- the assessor will typically perform a scan and perform a validation on critical high or medium risk vulnerabilites. Indicating that the vulnerability is present and it is not a false positive.

- Penetration  tests provides a detailed report on the vulnerability and detailed report on the organisation security, it isn't cost effective unlike vulnerability assessment.
- It is a simulated cyber attack to see if the network can be penetrated.


#### `Other Types of Security Assessments --           .`

- Vulnerability assessments and penetration tests are not the only types of security assessments that an organization can perform to protect its assets. Other types of assessments may also be necessary, depending on the type of the organization.

#### `1. Security Audits -->`

- `Security audits` are typically requirements from outside the organization, and they're typically mandated by `government agencies` or `industry associations` to assure that an organization is compliant with specific security regulations.

Ex:- Online and offline retailers who accept major credit cards must comply with **PCI-DSS**

#### `2. Bug Bounties -->`

- Organisations invite general public to find vulnerabilites in their applications. These kind of programs are generally implemented by all kinds of organisations.

#### `3. Red Team Assessment -->`

- A red team is a type of evasive black box pentesting, simulating all kinds of cyber attacks from the perspective of an external threat actor.
- These assessments typically have an end goal (i.e., reaching a critical server or database, etc.). The assessors only report the vulnerabilities that led to the completion of the goal, not as many vulnerabilities as possible as with a penetration test.

####  `4. Purple Team Assessment -->`

- `Purple teams` are formed when `offensive` (Red) and `defensive` (Blue) security specialists work together with a common goal, to improve the security of their network.
